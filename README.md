# Guessing Game
This is a small game made entirely using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

# Rules
* When a game begins, there should be a random number generated between 1-100
* The user has an input field where they can submit a guess
* After the user submits a guess, it will be indicated whether their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' and if they need to guess higher or lower
* The user can only guess for 5 times. When they run out of guesses or when they win let them know the game is over
* The user can only put an integer between 1-100
* The user cannot repeat the same guess number
* You can use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to help you, but not necessary
* To help with your development process, you can use [Testem](https://github.com/testem/testem) to do Test Driven Development just like in previous projects, but not necessary
