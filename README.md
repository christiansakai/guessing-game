# Guessing Game
This is a small game made entirely using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

# Game Rule 
* When a game begins, there should be a random number generated between 1-100
* The user has an input field where they can submit a guess
* After the user submits a guess, it will be indicated whether their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' and if they need to guess higher or lower
* The user can only guess for 5 times. When they run out of guesses or when they win let them know the game is over
* The user can only put an integer between 1-100
* The user cannot repeat the same guess number
